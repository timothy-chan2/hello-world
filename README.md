Following the Hello World GitHub Guide to create a repository, manage a new branch, push commits, and manage a pull request

I have an engineering background living in Canada. I'm planning to work as a front-end web developer by studying hard, working on many projects, and networking with other developers. I've already learned about HTML and CSS and completed some small projects. I'm currently going through the lessons about JavaScript and learning about how to use GitHub so I can combine all that I've learned.
